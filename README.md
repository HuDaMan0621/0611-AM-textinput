In this assignment you are going to create a Stepper view control

Part 1
Create a new component that will allow the user to increment and decrement the values when the "+" or "-" buttons are clicked. A sample design of the Stepper View control is shown below:



You can use any design you like but it needs to increase and decrease the number by 1. It should manage it's own state (i.e. a class component rather than a functional component).

Part 2
Once you have the input field working with the plus and minus buttons, change the text to an input field and allow the user to enter a number directly. You will need to account for validation here, as the text field will allow a user to enter things other than numbers.

 

BONUS:
Think of a way you can make this input the WORST experience possible.
